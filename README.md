# netflix-skip-intro

A browser extension / plugin to 'Skip Intro' on Netflix shows.

Basically I got annoyed by needing to manually click the 'Skip Intro' button on Netflix when watching on my computer, so I wrote a browser plugin to do it for me.

To run locally:

Load the extension in Chrome:

Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
Select your extension directory from the file dialog and click "Select".

I don't feel like paying the $5 fee right now to publish this to chrome store. ðŸ¤·
